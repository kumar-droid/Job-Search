Setting the correct expectations

CRITSIT case, where it is impacting the production like website is down, rendering issue, Edge Crash or a known bug, regression.

If it is CRITSIT | Sev A then every Sev A case we have CRIT and IM assgined to that case so that they'll make sure the engineer will get enagaged to the cx. as soon as possible in case of production down issue.

FQR (First Quality Response) to inform the cx. that I'm the engineer engaged on this case and share my work timing and also check if cx. is available for the Teams call.
First, we try to understand the issue and then start the scoping 

asking question like

Did it ever work previously, and now failing? or Is this a new setup?
How many users are affected? If not all users are affected, is this specific to a geographical location? to understand the criticallity of the issue.

We also check whether its related to any ongoing known bug or regression while checking the list.

Kerberos Authentication

The client initiates the authentication process by sending a request to the KDC for a ticket to access a particular service on the server.

The KDC verifies the client's identity and generates two tickets: a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and a Service Ticket. The TGT is encrypted with the client's credentials and is used for subsequent authentication requests. The Service Ticket is encrypted with the server's secret key and is used to authenticate with the specific service.

The client receives the TGT and caches it for future use. The client then sends the Service Ticket request to the KDC, providing the TGT and the server's information.

The KDC validates the TGT and issues the Service Ticket to the client.

The client presents the Service Ticket to the server to request access to the desired service.

The server verifies the authenticity of the Service Ticket by decrypting it using its own secret key. If the decryption is successful, the server grants access to the client for the requested service.

Bug: A bug refers to a defect or an issue in the software that causes it to behave unexpectedly or incorrectly. Bugs can occur at any stage of the software development lifecycle and can result from coding errors, design flaws, or other factors. Bugs are typically unintended and are considered as problems that need to be fixed.

Regression: Regression, on the other hand, refers to the reoccurrence of a previously fixed or working functionality that has now become defective again after changes have been made to the software. In other words, a regression occurs when a change in the software introduces a new bug or causes a previously resolved bug to resurface. Regression testing is performed to ensure that existing functionalities are not affected by new changes.

To summarize, a bug is any defect or issue in the software, while a regression specifically refers to the reappearance of a previously fixed or working defect.
